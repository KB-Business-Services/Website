### Academic Excellence

The Center for Leadership Studies is the home of Northwest University’s Ph.D. and Ed.D. programs in Organizational Leadership. Both degree programs hold full accreditation from the Northwest Commission on Colleges and Universities.

Northwest’s Ph.D. and Ed.D. offer concentrations in:

- Leading Ministry Organizations
- Business Leadership and Consulting
- Higher Education Leadership

The Center houses the program’s development and serves as a support base for its students, facilitating their success and dissertation completion.

### Faith Integration

The Ph.D. and Ed.D. programs shape “scholar/practitioners” from a Christian perspective who can draw from the highest intellectual levels, and the depths of faith simultaneously. “Our students will write the books everyone is reading, and lead the organizations everyone is copying, not by avoiding their faith, but by living it.”

The Center for Leadership Studies also serves as a platform for leadership conferences, a host for visiting scholars, a source for organizational consulting, a catalyst for research, and a stimulus for new books, articles, and training resources.

### Learning Environment

The CLFS doctoral experience is cohort-based, placing diverse students in an interdisciplinary learning environment. With classes taking place on campus, online, or on the road, each features strong, supportive relational connections. These relationships thrive in a hybrid format delivered 50% online.

Northwest is located amidst many of the most influential organizations of our time, including Microsoft, Boeing, Costco, Amazon, World Vision, and the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation. In fact, the Google-Kirkland campus is less than half a mile from our front door. These game-changing corporations create a powerful context for students investigating organizational leadership.
