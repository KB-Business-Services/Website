## Quiet Quitting and Reasoned Action
The Quiet Quitting phenomenon has exploded in its importance in organizations of all types as workers have resisted
the changes in the employer-employee relationship of the past two decades. The purpose of this paper is to identify the
importance of the Theory of Reasoned Action and beliefs, attitudes, intentions, and behaviors that impact Quiet
Quitting. Citing from scholarly literature, we explain the four key elements of the Theory of Reasoned Action and how
they impact Quiet Quitting.

## Virtuous Leadership: Insights from the Example of Joseph
This paper is a conceptual paper that identifies eight testable propositions about virtuous leadership, incorporating
insights from the example of Joseph, the eleventh son of Jacob, as set forth in the Old Testament. Joseph, or Yosuf, is
one of the most highly regarded individuals in holy writ and an exemplar of virtuous leadership. We introduce and
explain the nature of virtuous leadership and summarize the life of Joseph, as set forth in the Old Testament and the
Qur’an. We identify seven key characteristics of virtuous leadership and cite examples from Joseph’s life that
demonstrate those qualities. We conclude the paper by identifying five contributions of the paper for practitioners
and scholars.

## Caribbean Youth and Resilience: Exploring Levels of Engagement in Extracurricular Activities, Leadership Traits and Their Effects on the Resilience of Grenadian Youth
The purpose of the study was to analyze the influence of extracurricular activity leaders on the resilience of secondary grade students. A large body of research has documented extracurricular activities for its compensatory and protective functions. As a result, youth living within socioeconomically disadvantaged communities can benefit from participating in extracurricular activities. The objective of this study was to explore levels of engagement in extracurricular activities and leadership traits’ interactions in the explanation of students’ resilience. The sample of this quantitative correlational study consisted of 150 Grenadian youth, ages 13 to 16. Participants completed the Grenadian Youth Engagement and Leadership Trait questionnaire, Student Resilience Survey, and the Grenadian Youth and Resilience Study Demographic questionnaire collecting sociodemographic data. The results show a statistically non-significant effect of levels of engagement on students’ resilience. However, this study found a statistically significant effect of leadership traits observation on the overall resilience of school-aged youth. These results support the study research question that an influential leader in extracurricular activities functions as a protective mechanism for positive youth development. This study is unique in its analysis of data collected on the trait theory of leadership and student resilience separately and provides invaluable information about the understudied population of school-aged Grenadian youth. Study conclusions support the significance of particular leadership traits impacting student resilience and the integration of extracurricular activities within schools and communities.
